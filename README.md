## üéØ Project Overview

This research project investigates the use of simulative environments and large-scale deep reinforcement learning to train and optimize agents for bipedal locomotion and robotic movement/perception.

### Key Components

- Deep reinforcement learning within large-scale simulative environments
- Coordinated bipedal locomotion through multi-agent autonomy
- Sim2Real transfer and integration in preparation for real-world use

### System Requirements / Specifications

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Linux: Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL 2)
- Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NumPy
- CUDA Toolkit

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- Neural network models and deep reinforcement learning algorithms are formulated
- Isaac Sim renders the URDF and simulative environments for large-scale RL
- ROS 2 integrates the models and perception systems together
