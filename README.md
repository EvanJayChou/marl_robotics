# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Coordinated Bipedal Robotics

This research project investigates the use of simulative environments and large-scale deep reinforcement learning to train and optimize agents for bipedal locomotion and robotic movement/perception.

## Key Components

- Deep reinforcement learning within simulative environments
- Bipedal locomotion via multi-agent autonomy

## Software Libraries/Technologies

- Isaac Sim
- Isaac Gym
- Ubuntu 22.04 Linux
- Stable-Baselines3
